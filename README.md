##  🔮 explanation!!!

### modul 1
in the program uses the function:<br>
printf = to print (output) data to the computer screen<br>
The program prints 'hello world' which has been entered by the user using the printf function

### modul 2
Module 2
The program uses the printf function to print data and scanf to read user inputted data<br>
The program also uses data types:<br>
Char ➡️ to store one single character<br>. 
Integer ➡️ to store whole numbers.<br>

### modul 3
The program uses data types, constants, and variables<br> 
task31 ➡️ uses integer data type (to store integers) <br>
​task32 ➡️ uses the float data type (to store fractional numbers) <br> 
​task33 ➡️ use float and constant data types (to define values ​​that cannot be changed during program execution) <br>

### modul 4
The program in module 4 uses arithmetic operators➡️ operators which are used for operations 
mathematics <br>
➕(summation)<br>
➖(subtraction)<br>
➗(division)<br>
✖️(multiplication)<br>
% (remaining quotient)<br>
### modul 5
The program in module 5 uses flow control switch case, if/else, and else if:<br>
- An if/else branch is a branch that has two choice blocks. <br>
- An if/else/if branch is a branch that has more than two choice blocks.<br>
The first option block is for the true condition, and the second option is for the condition 
wrong (else).<br>
- Switch case branching is another form of if/else/if branching <br>

### modul 6
In tasks 61,62,63 ➡️ use a for loop to create a star pattern program
The for loop is a repetition that is included in the couted loop, 
because it was clear how many times he would repeat it<br>
Task 64 ➡️
in that program<br>
Using switch case loops and if/else/if loops:<br>

- An if/else/if branch is a branch that has more than two 
selection block<br>
- The first option block is for the true condition, and the second option is for the condition 
wrong (else).<br>
- Switch case branching is another form of if/else/if branching.<br>

### modul 7
This program uses Arrays. Arrays are data structures used for storing 
a collection of data in one place, this array is also called an array. 
Each data in the Array has an index, so we will have it easy 
processing it such as accessing or changing the data.
And also use: <br>
constant ➡️ to define values ​​that cannot be changed during program execution<br>
switch case ➡️another form of if/else/if branching<br>
if else ➡️ branching that has two select blocks.<br>

### modul 8
