##  üîÆ explanation!!!

### modul 1
in the program uses the function:<br>
printf = to print (output) data to the computer screen<br>
The program prints 'hello world' which has been entered by the user using the printf function

### modul 2
Module 2
The program uses the printf function to print data and scanf to read user inputted data<br>
The program also uses data types:<br>
Char ‚û°Ô∏è to store one single character<br>. 
Integer ‚û°Ô∏è to store whole numbers.<br>

### modul 3
The program uses data types, constants, and variables<br> 
task31 ‚û°Ô∏è uses integer data type (to store integers) <br>
‚Äãtask32 ‚û°Ô∏è uses the float data type (to store fractional numbers) <br> 
‚Äãtask33 ‚û°Ô∏è use float and constant data types (to define values ‚Äã‚Äãthat cannot be changed during program execution) <br>

### modul 4
The program in module 4 uses arithmetic operators‚û°Ô∏è operators which are used for operations 
mathematics <br>
‚ûï(summation)<br>
‚ûñ(subtraction)<br>
‚ûó(division)<br>
‚úñÔ∏è(multiplication)<br>
% (remaining quotient)<br>
### modul 5
The program in module 5 uses flow control switch case, if/else, and else if:<br>
- An if/else branch is a branch that has two choice blocks. <br>
- An if/else/if branch is a branch that has more than two choice blocks.<br>
The first option block is for the true condition, and the second option is for the condition 
wrong (else).<br>
- Switch case branching is another form of if/else/if branching <br>

### modul 6
In tasks 61,62,63 ‚û°Ô∏è use a for loop to create a star pattern program
The for loop is a repetition that is included in the couted loop, 
because it was clear how many times he would repeat it<br>
Task 64 ‚û°Ô∏è
in that program<br>
Using switch case loops and if/else/if loops:<br>

- An if/else/if branch is a branch that has more than two 
selection block<br>
- The first option block is for the true condition, and the second option is for the condition 
wrong (else).<br>
- Switch case branching is another form of if/else/if branching.<br>

### modul 7
This program uses Arrays. Arrays are data structures used for storing 
a collection of data in one place, this array is also called an array. 
Each data in the Array has an index, so we will have it easy 
processing it such as accessing or changing the data.
And also use: <br>
constant ‚û°Ô∏è to define values ‚Äã‚Äãthat cannot be changed during program execution<br>
switch case ‚û°Ô∏èanother form of if/else/if branching<br>
if else ‚û°Ô∏è branching that has two select blocks.<br>

### modul 8
The program uses functions
Functions are sub-programs that can be reused either within
the program itself, as well as in other programs.
An example of a function that we often create is the main() function.
This function is mandatory in every C program because it will be executed
first time.<br>

- The function used is the int function<br>
- and also uses switch case, if/else, and arithmetic operators<br>

### modul 9
The program uses<br>
- pointers/memory addresses‚û°Ô∏è to determine the location of data storage
memory (RAM).<br>
- and uses a while loop ‚û°Ô∏è a type of looping statement in the C programming language which is used to run a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition evaluates to true.<br>
- for loop ‚û°Ô∏è is a type of looping statement in the C programming language which is used to repeat the execution of a block of code with a known or predictable number of iterations.<br>

### modul 10
The program use 
- Structure or struct is a collection of several variables with various variations
data types wrapped in one variable.<br>
- typedef struct keyword to define a new data type.<br>
We can use this keyword in front of the struct to declare it
as a new data type.<br>
- do while loop ‚û°Ô∏è a type of looping statement in the C language that is used to run a block of code at least once, and then repeat as long as a certain condition is met<br>
- An if/else branch is a branch that has two choice blocks.<br>
- and also use include time to use the srand function<>br

### modul 11
